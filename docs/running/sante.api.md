SANTÃ© also has a standalone Spring Boot API with five different endpoints.
This Spring Boot application can be run by changing into the `sante.api` directory and executing
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dindex.path=YOUR_INDEX_PATH_GOES_HERE
```

Once the application is running, by default, the documentation (Swagger) for all the applications endpoints can be accessed via
